In February 2018 **David Rhodes** [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43043842) that lap dancing clubs, sex shops and sex cinemas numbers in England had fallen by a third in the past five years.

The BBC England Data Unit sent Freedom of Information requests to all local councils responsible for issuing sex establishment licences with 281 out of 327 responding to how many they had issued.
